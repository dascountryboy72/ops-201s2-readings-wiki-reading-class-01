System Restore

**The benefits of a system restore:**

1. Recover -in the event of a corrupted file, update failure, or a virus, you can use the system to restore from a previous backed up file. 
2. Change - if you make a mistake that ends up corrupting files, you can undo the change through a system restore. 
3. Trouble shooting - this is a great option for alleviating any major problems for causing frustrating moments. 
4. Saves time - rather then trying to trace back, system restore can be done rather quickly. Just remember to back up your system often so you have a more current space to restore from.
